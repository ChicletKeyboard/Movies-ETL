# Movies-ETL

This analysis was conducted to creeate an automated ETL pipeline. The pipeline reads new data, transforms said data by cleaning and condensing into a more usable format, and loading the data into Postgresql tables for further analysis as needed by others. We refactored the code into a function to make it more streamlined than before.
